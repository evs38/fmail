          ====================

          If you currently are using FMail version 1.02, do the following:
          -    Backup you config files and your executables. 
          -    Copy the new executables over the old ones.
          -    Start  FSetup and  go into  the  Area Manager  and the  Node
               Manager. Save changes when exiting.

          IMPORTANT: Some programs  that access the FMail  config files may
          not  be  able to  do  so any  more  after the  upgrade.  With the
          AutoExport feature, you can export  FMail config files in the old
          format  to another directory thus enabling other programs to keep
          working properly.



          THE MOST IMPORTANT NEW FEATURES IN FMAIL 1.22
          =============================================
          -    There's   a  new  Global  function  in  AreaMgr.  It's  also
               available in  the Node Manager  as well! You first  make the
               desired  changes  in  the  record.  Changed  fields  get  an
               asterisk in front of the field name. Fields with an asterisk
               are  the only  fields that  will  be update  in de  selected
               records. You can also turn  the asterisk by pressing INS and
               turn it off by pressing DEL. In the Area Manager you can use
               the groups to select areas. In the Node Manager you  can use
               node numbers with wildcards to select records.
          -    SEEN-BYs are now stored in the right JAM subfields again.
          -    FMail Pack zone number bug  fixed. This bug caused FMail not
               to see  the right  zone number of  netmail messages  if they
               were not  from the main  AKA's zone and  did not  contain an
               INTL kludge.
          -    I think the  netmail import problem is fixed  too. I suspect
               it was caused  by the zone number problem  which also caused
               FMail Pack to use the wrong zone number.
          -    The 32-bit  versions of  FMail do  not require  FMLX_ARC any
               more.
          -    The problem  with the Other  AKAs option in the  AreaMgr has
               been fixed.
          -    ProBoard export fixed.
          -    List general config fixed (gave an exception if Proboard was
               selected in FSetup).
          -    The RA 2.5 AutoExport now exports the area number correctly.
          -    FMail now marks scanned JAM messages as deleted/sent.
          -    FTools POST file attach bug has been fixed.
          -    The maximum size  of JAM subfields  has been increased  from
               4096 to 8192.
          -    The Areafix  exception bug in  32 bit versions of  FMail has
               been fixed.
