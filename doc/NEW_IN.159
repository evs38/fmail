UPGRADE INFORMATION:
====================

If you currently are using an FMail version between 1.02 and 1.46,
do the following:
- Backup you config files and your executables.
- Copy the new executables over the old ones.
- Start FSetup and go into the Area Manager and the Node
  Manager. Save changes when exiting.

IMPORTANT: Some programs that access the FMail config files may
not be able to do so any more after the upgrade. With the AutoExport
feature, you can export FMail config files in the old 1.02 format
to another directory thus enabling other programs to keep working
properly.


NEW/FIXED IN 1.59d/beta
=======================
- Long filenames support for JAM bases has been fixed.
- A problem in the dupe system that could cause exceptions has been fixed.
- A problem that caused FMail to be slow when the MT aware switch was
  enabled has been fixed.
- NEW: FTools Addnew now also can create the AutoUpdate files if you add /A.


NEW FEATURES IN 1.59/beta
=========================
- The maximum number of nodes has been increased to 8000 for 32 bit and
  DOS-DPMI versions.
- FTOOLS ADDNEW function has been added. If you run this command after new
  areas have been received (FMail Toss), these areas will be added to
  FMAIL.AR (using the defaults you set on the AreaMgr defaults page in
  FSetup). After that, you can run FMAIL TOSS /B to retoss the bad messages.
  You can detect the arrival of new areas by testing from your batch file
  whether or not FMAIL.BDE exists in the FMail directory.
- NT compressed directories are now supported.
- The product code list has been updated to FTSCPROD.005.
- It's now possible to have netmail messages sent by you be moved to the
  Personal Mail directory (extra Yes/No toggle).
- It's now possible to do JAM base maintenance for selected areas.
- EleBBS support added.
- SMTP now can handle multiple filenames when sending netmail messages
  with more than one file attached.


PROBLEMS FIXED IN 1.59/beta
===========================
- The bug where FMAIL TOSS /B could corrupt the Hudson message base if at
  the time of execution the message base was almost full has been fixed.
- Extra checks on the Hudson message base size have been added to prevent
  message base problems.
- Fixed statistics in SUMMARY.LOG file.
- Fixed sort problem of the export addresses in the Area Manager.
- Global update of the Comment field in the Area Manager has been fixed.
- Rescan via '=' command in AreaFix messages has been fixed.
- Update of the QuickBBS info has been fixed.
- Some time zone related problems have been fixed.
- A small Y2K problem (100 in Toss Summary log file) has been fixed.
- Not all memory was released after using the 'List members' in FSetup.
  This has been fixed.
- Problem with wrong destination of 'Passive' notify message has been fixed.


PROBLEMS FIXED IN 1.48b
=======================
- The problem of MsgInfo.BBS not being updated correctly has been fixed.
- Sometimes FMail displayed negative message numbers. This has been fixed.
- There is a new switch /t for the FTools Maint command. It fixes problems
  with incorrect text length fields in MsgHdr.BBS. Normally you should not
  use this new switch.
- The export of AreaMgr information to a text file now displays the correct
  read/write/sysop flags.
- FTools could cause a division by zero exception on volumes of certain
  sizes. This problem has been fixed.
- The prodoct code list has been updated (to FTSCPROD.003).
- The FastEcho areas import function now imports JAM message base names
  correctly.


PROBLEMS FIXED IN 1.48a
=======================
- The problems that were caused by a compilerbug in the 1.48 OS/2 version
  have been solved.
- "Registered users only" features should now work correctly.
- The text filter that removed 'high ASCII' characters from exported files
  has been removed itself! :-)
- There were some problems with the AKA selection screen in FSetup which
  have been fixed.
- The import routine for FastEcho area and node files has been fixed.
- If FMail could not determine the cluster size of a partition, a division
  by zero error could occur. This has been fixed.
- Fixed some problems in the SMTP code.
- Improved checking for bad dates in PKT files caused by third party software
  that is not Y2K compliant.
- File attaches with BCL files now contain the right source and destination
  addresses.
- If you try to clear the email address in the Node Manager, you no longer
  get a message that the address is not valid.
- Some problems with the Hudson base have been fixed (badly updated
  MSGINFO.BBS etc).
- Some problems with the JAM base have hopefully been fixed (seek errors).
- In order to track the cause of problems with the AutoPassive system in
  the Node Manager, a new date field has been added. It is called 'Ref'
  and contains the reference date that is used by FMail to determine if
  the node should be set to passive. It is normally the same as the
  'New bundle' date, but is cleared when the status of a node is changed
  from Passive to Active.

The program EXPFIX fixes a problem that sometimes occurs when installing the
current version of FMail (1.48/48a/48b) over an earlier version.
The export addresses in the Area Manager then seem to have disappeared.
If you then run EXPFIX once, the export addresses should be back (running
it again will make the addresses disappear again).


NEW FEATURES IN FMAIL 1.48
==========================
- Problems with the AutoBCL areafix command have been fixed
- Dups are not tossed in the Bad messages area anymore
- The TOSS /B command works again
- Some problems in the export to GoldEd (AREAS.GLD) have been fixed
- If a mail bundle is locked, FMail will now create a new bundle instead
  of displaying an error message.
