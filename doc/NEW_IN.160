UPGRADE INFORMATION:
====================
If you currently are using an FMail version between 1.02 and 1.49,
do the following:
- Backup you config files and your executables.
- Copy the new executables over the old ones.
- Start FSetup and go into the Area Manager and the Node
  Manager. Save changes when exiting.

IMPORTANT: Some programs that access the FMail config files may
not be able to do so any more after the upgrade. With the AutoExport
feature, you can export FMail config files in the old 1.02 format
to another directory thus enabling other programs to keep working
properly.


NEW FEATURES IN 1.60
====================
- The maximum number of nodes has been increased to 8000 for 32 bit and
  DOS-DPMI versions.
- FTOOLS ADDNEW function has been added. If you run this command after new
  areas have been received (FMail Toss), these areas will be added to
  FMAIL.AR (using the defaults you set on the AreaMgr defaults page in
  FSetup). After that, you can run FMAIL TOSS /B to retoss the bad messages.
  You can detect the arrival of new areas by testing from your batch file
  whether or not FMAIL.BDE exists in the FMail directory.
  If you add the switch /A, the files that are normally updated by FSetup's
  AutoUpdate feature, will also be updated by FTools AddNew.
- NT compressed directories are now supported.
- The product code list has been updated to FTSCPROD.005.
- It's now possible to have netmail messages sent by you be moved to the
  Personal Mail directory (extra Yes/No toggle).
- It's now possible to do JAM base maintenance for selected areas.
- EleBBS support added.
- SMTP now can handle multiple filenames when sending netmail messages
  with more than one file attached.
- FTools Addnew now also can create the AutoUpdate files if you add /A.

FIXED IN 1.60
