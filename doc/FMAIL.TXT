1   Introduction



FMail is an echomail and netmail processor for the Hudson and JAM
message bases. There's also a special version available that
support the QuickBBS Goldbase message base. FMail has a built-in
AreaFix-like function, called AreaMgr, with new commands like
%RESCAN, %ACTIVE and %PASSIVE. Ten different types of archives are
supported. FMail has its own netmail routing function, called the
Pack Manager. With FMail it is possible to make a copy of all
personal mail in a special directory. Other features of FMail
include:

-   Capable of handling 4D addresses.

-   If needed FMail automatically remaps fakenet addresses to 4D
    addresses and vice versa.

-   Swaps to disk, EMS or XMS before running an archiving utility
    (DOS versions).

-   Supports the message base sharing specifications also used by
    RemoteAccess and FrontDoor.

-   Multiple netmail boards in the message base.

-   Optionally sorts and links messages in the Hudson of JAM
    message base after new messages have been imported.

1.3   Files

FMail, FSetup and FTools create and use a number of files. Except
for the last three files, FMail will create and look for these
files in the directory where FMail is located, even if the current
directory is a different one. The files are:

FMAIL.CFG      General configuration file.

FMAIL.AR       Contains the area configuration used by FMail.

FMAIL.ARD      Contains  the area  configuration  defaults used  by
               FMail.

FMAIL.NOD      Contains the node configuration used by FMail.

FMAIL.PCK      Contains  the  netmail routing  information  used by
               FMail's PACK function.

FMAIL.DUP      Contains  the database  with signatures  of messages
               used by  FMail to  detect duplicate messages.  FMail
               keeps track of the last 16384 messages.

FMAIL32.DUP    The 32-bit version of the duplicate detection  file.
               It is  capable of  keeping track of  more duplicates
               than the 16-bit DOS version. (max. 9999*1024).

FMAIL.LOC      This file  is opened by  FMail in  the message  base
               directory  to prevent multiple  copies of FMail from
               operating  on  the same  message  base  at the  same
               time. This file will not be deleted afterwards.

MSG*.FML       These  files  are   created  in  the   message  base
               directory  when  FMail is  running  in  message base
               sharing  mode.  Normally  FMail  will  append  these
               files to  the normal message base  files, but it can
               happen that this is  not possible. FMail will  retry
               to append them  to the normal message base files the
               next time it is started.

FMAIL.BDE      File created  by FMAIL.EXE when new areas are tossed
               and used by FSETUP.EXE to AutoCreate those areas.

*.QQQ          If  FMail  could  not  compress  the  outgoing  .PKT
               files, they  will be renamed to  .QQQ files and will
               remain in  the Outgoing  mail directory.  FMail will
               retry to compress  these .QQQ files the next time it
               is started.

*.TMP          In some cases  (e.g. a crash),  it is possible  that
               .TMP files  remain in  the Outbound  mail directory.
               In most  cases, these  files can be  deleted without
               any problem,  because the original mail has not been
               removed yet: the messages  will be tossed again  the
               next time FMail Toss is started.


1.4       System requirements

To use FMail you  need an IBM PC, AT, 386, 486  or Pentium or fully
compatible computer  with a mono or  color display and  a harddisk.

Also you need MS-DOS or  PC DOS 3.3 or  later for the DOS,  DOS/386
and DOS/DPMI version  and OS/2 2.1 or  later for the  OS/2 version.
To use the  Win32 version you must be using  either Windows NT/2000
or Windows 95/98/98SE/ME.

In  order to be  able to send  and receive mail,  you need a mailer
that is compatible with FTS-0001. For  reading and writing mail you
need a message editor or a BBS program  that uses the Hudson and/or
JAM message base format.

Finally you  need one or more  of these compression  programs: ARC,
PKZIP, LHA, PAK, ZOO, ARJ, SQZ, UC2, RAR, JAR.

















































1.5       Various notes

FMail  supports up to  32 AKAs.  Enter your  AKAs in FSetup  in the
same order  as in FrontDoor's FDSetup  and GoldED's setup,  i.e. if
you  have AKA 3 in FrontDoor  defined as 2:283/619, you should also
define AKA 3 in FSetup as 2:283/619.

When entering node numbers in FSetup  or on the FMail command-line,
always use  the 4 dimensional address  for points, not  the fakenet
address.

Node  numbers may be entered in an abbreviated way. FMail or FSetup
will use the main node number to complete the node number. E.g.  if
you enter  ".1" and the main  node number is 2:283/619,  FMail will
use 2:283/619.1. Likewise, "1" will be changed into 2:283/1.

FMail looks for the  compression and decompression programs in  the
directories that are  included in the DOS or  OS/2 PATH environment
variable.

If one  or more  compression utilities  are not  available on  your
system, you  should remove  them from FSetup.  That way,  they will
not be mentioned in AreaMgr receipts as being available.

Internally, FMail  always uses 4-dimensional addresses. If FMail is
handling mail from  or to a  fakenet address, the  address will  be
internally  converted  into   the  corresponding  4D  address.   If
necessary, the 4D  address will be converted back  into the fakenet
address if that is required by the receiving system.

IMPORTANT: As a  consequence, all node numbers entered  in the node
manager or the area manager should be 4D addresses!!!





























2         Getting started


A  good place  to put  the files  that are  included in  this FMail
package   is  the   system  directory   of  your   mailer.  Another
possibility is  to create a separate  directory to store  the FMail
executables in.  After you have copied  the FMail executables  to a
directory on  your harddisk, type FSETUP  and press the  ENTER key.
Now  a menu pops up. If  you use a monochrome  monitor and the text
is  difficult to read,  try using the /M  switch after FSETUP. This
will force FSetup not to use any colours.

FMail looks  for its configuration files  in the same  directory as
the executable,  even if it  is not the  current directory.  If you
want  FMail to  look for  the  configuration files  in a  different
directory, set  the FMAIL environment  variable to where  the files
are, e.g. SET FMAIL=C:\FIDO\FMAIL.

You can only  start one of  the FMail  programs (FMail, FSetup,  or
FTools) at the  same time in  the same directory.  When you try  to
start a  second program, this program  will display a  message that
another FMail  program is still running.  If the other  program has
not stopped within 30 seconds, the program will abort.


2.1       Converting config files of other echomail processors

FSetup has the capability to import the configuration files of a
number of other echomail processors: IMAIL, TosScan and all
programs that can export AREAS.BBS file. Before using this
capability however, you first should enter all node numbers you
will be using and include the fakenet numbers you are using, if
any. This way, FMail will automatically convert all fakenet
addresses in the configuration files into 4-dimensional addresses
that are used by FMail.

IMPORTANT:

1.        Always check the imported configuration files.
2.        The archiver  program to  be used  will not  be converted
          correctly in the node manager.




















3         FSetup


FSetup is  the menu  oriented setup  utility for  FMail. First  the
keys  that  can  be  used  to   enter  information  in  FSetup  are
discussed. The rest of the chapter discusses all menus in FSetup.


3.1       FSetup keys

               current position of the cursor                Delete
-         Delete the character left of the cursor         Backspace
-         Delete rest of the field                         Ctrl-End
-         Clear the entire field                             Ctrl-Y

-         Accept contents of data field                       Enter
-         Restore original contents of data field               ESC
-         Toggle insert mode                                 Insert
-         Shell to DOS                                        ALT-Z

When editing a group selection window:
-         Select all groups                                  Insert
-         Deselect all groups                                Delete
-         Toggle an entry                      The listed character













3.2       Main menu

The main menu of FSetup contains seven options:

Miscellaneous

          Allows  you   to  enter  general  information  about  the
          message base and how messages should be handled.

System info

          Information  about  directories,  swapping,   compression
          programs etc.  can be  entered via  the System  info sub-
          menu.

Import/Export

          With the  Import/Export option,  you can  export selected
          parts of the configuration to a  text file or printer. It
          is also possible to  import area and node  configurations
          of IMail and TosScan.

Uplink Manager

          The  uplink   manager  contains  information   about  the
          systems  you receive  most of  your echomail  from. Areas
          can  be  connected and  disconnected  from  these systems
          automatically when  requested by  your downlinks, if  you
          allow it.

Pack Manager

          The  pack  manager  is  used  to  enter  netmail  routing
          information. This information is  used by the FMail  Pack
          function.

Node Manager

          The   node  manager   is  used   to  review   and  update
          information about  your uplinks  and  downlinks. You  can
          set passwords, etc. in here.

Area Manager

          The  area  manager is  used  to  enter information  about
          echomail areas that are processed by FMail.















3.3       Miscellaneous

The "Miscellaneous" menu contains nine options, which will be
described below.


3.3.1     General options

This option shows a menu that lets you enter general configuration
information:

Sysop Name

          Your name. It is used for determining whether or not
          netmail should be imported into the message base netmail
          board and if mail is addressed to you. Your registration
          keys (if you are a registered user) are also dependent
          on the name you enter here.

Mailer

          The mailer program you are using. Supported mailers are
          FrontDoor, InterMail, D'Bridge, Binkley, Portal of
          Power, MainDoor and Xenia. If your mailer is compatible
          with any of these, it can be used too.

Busy flags

          FMail can create busy flags for FrontDoor and InterMail.
          It prevents these mailers from polling systems that you
          are currently compressing mail for.

BBS program

          The BBS program you are using (if any). Supported
          programs are RemoteAccess (versions earlier than 2.00,
          2.00/2.01/2.02 and 2.50), SuperBBS, QuickBBS, TAG and
          ProBoard. This information is only used by the
          AutoExport function, and you need not specify it if you
          don't plan on using AutoExport.

Tearline (registered users only)

          You can define which type of tearline you would like
          FMail to use for messages from your system. The options
          range from the standard FMail tearline to a custom
          tearline or no tearline at all. If you want the tearline
          to be empty or absent, you can tell FMail to use a
          Tosser ID (TID) ^A kludge instead.

Custom (registered users only)

          If you select 'Custom' as the tearline type, FMail will
          use the tearline you enter here.

ReTear (registered users only)

          If FMail should replace an existing tearline. Normally
          FMail only retears the message in the outbound packets
          it generates. If you want FMail to update the message

          text in the message base as well, enable the switch
          'Update text after scan' (see section 3.3.2 below).


3.3.2     Message base

This option shows a menu that lets you control the way the message
base will be handled.

Netmail boards

Netmail boards
FMail allows you to use different netmail boards for each of your
AKA's. Information about these netmail areas can be entered in a
sub-menu. The information includes:

-         A comment that will be used in the areas files that can
          be created by FSetup AutoExport feature.
-         Hudson message base board number. It is possible to use
          a board number for more than one AKA. If you do this,
          only the information of the first netmail area that uses
          a particular message base board will be used, eg. by
          AutoExport to create the FrontDoor and GoldED areas
          files and by FTools for determining which messages
          should be deleted. JAM netmail boards are not yet
          supported, but will be in a future release.
-         Information that is used by FTools for message base
          maintenance purposes.
-         Security information to be used in the BBS area file.
          For more information about the options available in the
          BBS information menu, please refer to the documentation
          of your BBS package.

Bad message board

          Message base board number of the board in which bad
          messages will be stored.

Duplicate message board

          Hudson message base board number of the board in which
          duplicate messages will be stored. JAM is not yet
          supported for this purpose.

Recovery board

          Hudson message base board number of the board to which
          FTools Maint /C should move messages in boards that are
          not defined in FSetup. If the Recovery board is not
          defined, FTools Maint /C will delete all messages in
          undefined boards.

AutoRenumber

          FTools Maint will renumber your Hudson message base as
          soon as the highest message number in the message base
          has reached the AutoRenumber limit.





Check dupe net boards

          FMail normally allows you to use the same message base
          board for more than one AKA. If you set the Check dupe
          net boards option, FMail won't allow this anymore.

Import netmail to sysop

          If set to "No", messages addressed to your name or to
          "Sysop" will not be imported into the netmail board(s).
          This option has no effect if no netmail boards have been
          defined.

Remove 'Re:'

          Some message editors put "Re:" before the actual subject
          when replying to a message. FMail will remove the "Re:"
          from subject lines if you turn this option on.

Remove lf/soft cr

          Linefeeds and soft carriage returns are unnecessary in
          echomail messages. In order to save some diskspace, you
          may want to remove them. It will, however, slow the
          program down a bit.

Update text after Scan

          Write the text of the message as it will be sent to
          other systems back to the message base. This means that
          the message in the message base will contain PATH and
          SEEN-BY information. It will also contain an updated
          tearline, if you use the ReTear options (see 3.3.1).
          Previously, only Hudson areas were supported in this
          function, however this release supports both Hudson and
          JAM.

Update reply chains

          If set to "Yes", all message reply chains will be
          updated after messages have been tossed into the message
          base. Note that this slows down the tossing speed
          considerably.

Sort new messages

          If set to "Yes", new messages in the message base will
          be sorted according date and time.

Use subject

          Apart from date/time, also use the subject to sort new
          messages.

Message base sharing

          Allows concurrent access of FMail and the BBS software
          to the message base. DOS's SHARE should be installed if
          you are using the DOS version. OS/2, Windows NT and
          Windows 95 all have built-in SHARE file-locking support.

Scan always

          If set to "Yes", the messages base will always be
          completely scanned for outgoing messages. If set to
          "No", FMail relies on the files ECHOMAIL.BBS and
          NETMAIL.BBS for Hudson and/or ECHOMAIL.JAM for JAM areas
          to indicate new messages. If these files are found to be
          pointing to a message that does not qualify for export,
          a complete scan of the message base (or JAM base) will
          be performed.

Quick toss

          If enabled, this option slightly shortens the time taken
          by FMail after a packet has been tossed. Normally the
          message base files are closed and re-opened between
          packets, but this option causes the files not to be
          closed. Using this option, might, under extreme
          conditions, slightly increases the risk of losing some
          messages in the message base, eg. in the case of a power
          failure.

Tossed Areas List

          Writes a list of echomail areas in which mail has been
          tossed to the specified file.



































3.3.3     Mail options

This option shows you a menu that lets you control certain aspects
of the way FMail handles mail.

Never use ARCmail

          Never use the ARCmail 0.60 naming convention. Sometimes
          enabling this option may be necessary, because under
          some circumstances mail bundles you send to two
          different system may get the same ARCmail name, which
          causes problems.

Out-of-zone (only if the Never use ARCmail switch is set to No)

          Use ARCmail 0.60 naming convention for out-of-zone mail.
          Some other programs require the use of the ARCmail 0.60
          naming convention. Normally this is not necessary. Ask
          the sysops of your uplinks and downlinks if you are not
          sure.

Extended bundle names

          Use 0-9 and A-Z instead of only 0-9 for mail bundle name
          extensions. Warning: Some programs do not recognize
          bundle name extensions that do not end on a digit.

Check PKT destination

          If this option is enabled, only packets that are
          addressed to one of your AKAs (or to one of your points
          if you are not a point yourself) will be tossed. Packets
          addressed to other nodes will be renamed to files with
          the file name extension '.DST'.

Dupe detection

          Enables FMail's duplicate message detection system. If a
          duplicate message is found, it will be placed into the
          duplicate messages board (if defined). If the duplicate
          board is not defined, duplicate messages are deleted.

Ignore MSGID

          Normally FMail uses the MSGID of a message (if present)
          for duplicate detection purposes. In some cases, this
          may cause problems when different messages are having
          the same MSGID: one or more of these messages will be
          marked as duplicates although they are not. If you are
          frequently experiencing these problems, try setting this
          switch to 'Yes'.

Use EMS (standard DOS version only)

          Try to use EMS memory to store the signatures of
          messages in. This saves about 64 kb of conventional
          memory.




Dups recs (x1024) (32-bit mode only, start FSetupX with "/32")

          Number of signatures of messages that are stored on
          disk.

Max PKT size (kb)

          The maximum size of an outgoing PKT file in kilobytes.

Max bundle size (kb)

          The maximum size of an outgoing mail bundle (compressed
          mail file). The bundle may get a bit bigger than the
          requested size. It partly depends on the Max PKT size
          you entered. You are advised not to enter a relatively a
          large number there if you use Max bundle size.

Kill empty netmail

          Kill empty received netmail messages when scanning the
          netmail directory. If you enable this option, empty
          netmails will not be moved to the Received mail
          directory.

Kill bad ARCmail msg

          Kill ARCmail messages of which the attached mail bundle
          is missing. Can be used for example to remove file
          attach messages of mail bundles that are moved (eg. by a
          command in a batch file) from FMail's outbound directory
          to the inbound directory of a point's FMail in a network
          environment.

No point in PATH

          If this switch is enabled, FMail will not generate a
          PATH line in echomail messages that originate from a
          point system.

Max net msgs

          The maximum number of netmail messages allowed in one
          PKT file when tossing. If the maximum number is reached,
          the PKT file will be renamed to MLB (mail bomb).
          Normally there is no need to use this option and should
          it be set to 0.

Keep exported netmail

          Do not set the KILL flag on netmail messages that are
          exported from the message base.

Remove netmail kludges

          Some echomail processors cannot handle echomail messages
          containing netmail kludges (INTL, FMPT, TOPT). If some
          of your downlinks use such an echomail processor, you
          may want to enable the 'Remove netmail kludges' toggle.
          Please check the echomail policy of your net before
          using this option.

Set Pvt on import

          Set the Private flag on all netmail messages that are
          imported into the message base.

Daily mailbundles

          Create a new mail bundle every day.

3.3.4     Mgr options

For a more extensive explanation of some of the options below, see
also paragraph 3.8.

Keep requests

          Do not delete AreaMgr requests after they have been
          processed.

Keep receipts

          Do not set the KILL attribute on receipts created by
          AreaMgr.

Uplink Areas List

          Also send a list of areas available from uplinks to
          nodes that use the %LIST command

Allow %PASSWORD

          Allow nodes to change their AreaMgr passwords by sending
          a message to AreaMgr containing the %PASSWORD command.

Allow %PKTPWD

          Allow nodes to change their packet passwords by sending
          a message to AreaMgr containing the %PKTPWD command.

Allow %ACTIVE

          Allow nodes to change the status of their systems from
          active to passive and back through a message to AreaMgr
          containing the %PASSIVE and %ACTIVE commands.

Allow %COMPRESSION

          Allows nodes to use %COMPRESSION to change the
          compression method used for their mail.

Allow %NOTIFY

          Allows nodes to toggle the notify status on or off using
          the %NOTIFY command.

Allow %AUTOBCL

          Allows nodes to use the %AUTOBCL command. With this
          command, downlinks can ask FMail to send them a new
          Binary Conference Listing periodically. See page 27 for
          more information about this feature.

Allow %+ALL

          Allow nodes to use %+ALL to connect all areas available
          to them at once.

Auto-disconnect

          Automatically disconnect passthrough areas with only one
          link (export address).


3.3.5     Personal mail

FMail is able to scan all messages being tossed for messages
addressed to you personally and store them in a separate
directory.

Pers. mail path

          If you enter a directory name here, a copy of each
          echomail message that is directed to you (even if it is
          in a pass-through area) will be placed in *.MSG format
          in this directory. IMPORTANT: this directory should
          _never_ be the same as any other directory entered in
          FSetup.

Topic 1
Topic 2

          FMail has the ability to scan the subject lines of
          messages it is tossing for up to two keywords. If
          messages are found containing one of these keywords,
          they will be copied to the personal mail directory.
          Using this feature will slow down the tossing function a
          bit.

Include netmail

          Indicates whether or not personal netmail should also be
          copied to the personal mail directory.

Include sent netmail

          Indicates whether or not messages sent by the SysOp
          should also be copied to the personal mail directory.

New mail warning

          If enabled, FMail will send a netmail message to you,
          each time personal netmail or echomail messages have
          been tossed.

Users (registered users only)

          Enter up to eight names of users whose mail should be
          copied to the Personal mail board too.


3.3.6     Addresses 1/2


Your main address and up to fifteen other addresses that you may
use, can be entered in this window. If the echomail processors of
some of your points do not have Type 2+ capabilities, they will
have to receive their mail using the fakenet method. For each of
the 32 addresses you may enter a fakenet number. You can do this
by appending it to your normal 4-d address using a dash '-'. eg.
2:283/619-7619. Eg. if point 1 uses a none-Type 2+ tosser, mail
will be addressed to 2:7619/1.


3.3.7     Group names

If you are using a lot of different groups, remembering what each
group letter stands for can be rather difficult. The Group names
window lets you enter descriptions for all groups. These
descriptions will be used in the Node Manager, the Area Manager
and in AreaMgr replies.


3.3.8     AreaMgr defaults

To save some time when installing new areas in the Area Manager,
you may enter a number of default settings that will be used for
new areas. Of course, these values may be changed in the Area
Manager, should it be necessary. For more information about the
offered options, you are referred to the chapter about the Area
Manager.


































3.4       System info

The system info menu is used for various types of information that
are related to the system on which FMail is used.


3.4.1     Miscellaneous

Long file names

          Enables the use of long file names by DPMI and 32-bit
          versions FMail for JAM areas.

Max exports

          The maximum number of nodes that an area can be exported
          to. The default (and minimum) value is 64.

FMail MT aware

          Lets FMail return time slices when running in a multi-
          tasking environment. WARNING: on some systems, this may
          cause FMail to run extremely slow!

FTools MT aware

          Lets FTools return time slices when running in a multi-
          tasking environment. WARNING: on some systems, this may
          cause FTools to run extremely slow!

Extra handles

          If you have more than about 5 downlinks and you want
          FMail to run faster, you should allow FMail to use extra
          file handles. You may let FMail use up to 235 extra
          handles (apart from the standard 15 handles that are
          always available to FMail). ATTENTION: if you are
          running more than one program at the same time, please
          make sure that there are enough handles left for the
          other programs. Increase the FILES value in CONFIG.SYS
          if necessary.

Active time out

          When a copy on FMail, FTools or FSetup is already
          running and you start another one, that copy will wait
          until the one that started previously has ended. You can
          here set the maximum time that FMail should wait (0 =
          keep waiting).

Ctrl-Break

          If the Ctrl-Break option is enabled, you may stop FMail
          with Control-Break when tossing. This also may enlarge
          the time available to other programs when running in a
          multi-tasking environment.

Control codes

          Allow control codes to be entered in the Comment field
          in the Area Manager. This can be used for e.g. the

          export to Proboard to enter color codes. WARNING:
          exporting ASCII codes 1 to 26 to other programs may
          cause those programs to display erratic behaviour.

Buffer size (standard DOS version only)

          The size of FMail's internal buffers. Huge buffers
          require about 100 kb of free memory, while tiny buffers
          only require about 12 kb.

FT buf size (standard DOS version only)

          The size of FTools's internal buffers and FMail's
          buffers for sorting and updating reply chains.

Monochrome

          If enabled, FSetup will not use color, even if a color
          card is detected. This may be useful on systems using a
          monochrome monitor in combination with a color card.

Color set

          FSetup now comes in three flavours: Summer, Winter and
          Marine. If you select another color set, it will become
          visible the next time you start FSetup.


3.4.2     Directories

In the 'Directories' window you can enter a number of paths to
directories that will be used for specific files. IMPORTANT: Do
not use a directory more than once for FMail. Only Sent mail and
Received mail may point to the same directory if desired.

Message base

          The message base path points to the directory where the
          Hudson message base files are stored. The message base
          files are MSGHDR.BBS, MSGIDX.BBS, MSGTOIDX.BBS and
          MSGTXT.BBS.

          When FMail is running in message base sharing mode, it
          is possible that also files with the same names as the
          normal message base but with extensions .FML are present
          in the message base directory. Apart from the file name
          extension, this is a normal Hudson message base. When
          tossing and the optional sorting has finished, FMail
          tries to append the FML files to the normal message base
          files. This can go wrong for a number of reasons:

          -    The message base is locked.
          -    The resulting message base would be bigger than is
               allowed (e.g. the new MSGTXT.BBS would be bigger
               than 16 Mb). Use FTools to reduce the size of the
               message base.
          -    There is not enough disk space available. FMail
               needs an amount of free diskspace that is about
               equal to the combined size of all FML files. If
               appending the FML files to the BBS files goes
               wrong, FMail displays the message "Can't update the

               message base files". FMail will retry to append the
               FML files to the normal message base files the next
               time it is started.

Netmail

          The netmail directory contains netmail messages in *.MSG
          format. File attach messages will be placed in this
          directory.

Incoming mail

          The incoming mail directory is the directory where your
          mailer stores its received files. Incoming mail bundles
          will also be unpacked in this directory.

          Sometimes for some reason packets are not tossed by
          FMail. If this is the case, the PKT files will be
          renamed. The file name extensions of these remaining
          files indicate the nature of the problem:

          PKT  If there is not enough free disk space on your
               harddisk when a incoming PKT file is being tossed,
               FMail aborts and the PKT file remains in the
               'Incoming mail' directory.

          SEC  The password in this packet did not correspond with
               the password for the source node in the node
               manager.

          DST  The mail packet is not directed to your main node
               number or one of your AKAs.

          ERR  For some reason, the PKT header could not be read.

Outgoing mail

          The outgoing mail directory is where FMail will store
          the mail bundles it creates for other nodes. One special
          type of file may remain in the outgoing mail directory:

          QQQ  If FMail for some reason cannot compress an
               outgoing mailbundle, the file name extension will
               be changed from PKT into QQQ. If FMail is run
               again, it will first try to compress any packets
               with the QQQ extension if found.

Local PKTs (optional)

          If you are using some program that creates PKT files
          that you would like to have tossed by FMail, there may
          be a problem if you have security enabled in the Area
          Manager. Placing those packets in the Local PKTs
          directory will cause FMail to toss them, even if
          security is enabled for that particular echomail
          conference. CAUTION: Be very careful with what PKT files
          you place in the Local PKTs directory. It is very easy
          to create duplicates this way!



Sent mail (optional)
Received mail (optional)

          If the 'Sent mail' and/or 'Received mail' directories
          are defined, FMail will move sent and/or received
          netmail from the netmail directory to the appropriate
          directory: mail that has been sent, will be moved to the
          'Sent mail' directory if defined. Messages that have
          been received by the addressee will be moved to the
          'Received mail' directory. Messages with special
          attributes (file attach, in-transit) will never be moved
          to either one of these directories. Sent mail and
          Received mail may point to the same directory.

Sent echomail

          Directory where copies of sent echomail messages are
          stored.

Semaphore (optional)

          Indicates whether or not FMail should create the
          semaphore files (like FrontDoor's FDRESCAN.NOW and
          FMRESCAN.NOW) after netmail has been tossed.


3.4.3     Log files

Log style

          The layout that should be used for the log file.
          Possible settings are: FrontDoor, QuickBBS, D'Bridge and
          Binkley.

Log file name (optional)

          If you want a log file to be created, you should enter
          the desired path and filename here. IT IS NOT
          RECOMMENDED TO LET FMAIL SHARE A LOG FILE WITH ANOTHER
          PROGRAM THAT MAY RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY.

Log settings

          Various Yes/No switches let you set the specific
          information you want to have logged.

AreaMgr log

          If you want a separate log file containing information
          about AreaMgr requests to be created, you should enter
          path and filename here. If left blank, information about
          AreaMgr requests will be inserted in the normal log
          file.

Toss summary

          The Toss summary file contains information about the
          number of messages tossed into each area, about which
          nodes sent those messages and to which nodes those
          messages were forwarded.

3.4.4     Internet (Windows 32-bit only, start FSetup with /32)

The Windows 32-bit version of FMail is capable of sending mail
bundles directly to Internet e-mail addresses. In this section of
FSetup you can set up the necessary general parameters. If you
want to send mail for a particular uplink or downlink thru the
Internet, you need to enter the e-mail address of that node in the
Node Manager on the PKT path line. FMail can add text to e-mail
messages. If you place an ASCII file called EMAIL.TXT in the FMail
directory, its contents will be placed in the body of the e-mail
message.

Send smtp

          Set to Yes if you want to send mail thru the Internet.

Email address

          Enter your own e-mail address here.

SMTP server

          Enter the name of your mailserver here, e.g.
          mail.chello.nl

3.4.5     Swapping (standard DOS versions only)

Under some circumstances, there may not be enough memory left to
execute a compression or decompression program. To make sure that
there is enough memory available, you may want to enable swapping.
This means that FMail will temporarily remove itself from memory
to make room for the archiver.

There are three types of swapping available. The slowest type is
swapping to disk. FMail will try to swap itself to disk if the
other two methods are not available. These other two methods are
swapping to EMS and swapping to XMS. If both swapping to EMS and
swapping to XMS are enabled, FMail will first try XMS and if that
fails, it will try EMS. If you are running FMail under DESQview or
a similar program, make sure that there is enough EMS or XMS
available to FMail. Under DESQview the amount of EMS/XMS that is
available in a window can be changed via 'Change a Program'->
'Maximum Expanded Memory Size'. It should be left blank or be set
to at least 700 kb.

You may set the directory in which the swap file will be located
by entering the path to the desired directory. If left blank, the
swap file will be placed in the directory where FMail is located.


3.4.6     Compression and Compression/32

The programs that are used to compress your outgoing mail bundles
are listed here. FMail can handle nine different types of
archivers: ARC, ZIP, LZH, PAK, ZOO, ARJ, SQZ, UC2, RAR and JAR.
32-bit versions of FMail use the archivers listed in the
Compression/32 section. First the name of the program should be
listed, followed by optional arguments. Using the program name
with a full path lets FMail find the requested program faster and
prevents problems when there is another program with the same name
in a directory that is included in the path. Default settings for

each program are automatically created by FSetup when it is run
for the first time. There are separate windows for settings that
are use by the 16-bit versions of FMail and the 32-bit versions of
FMail.

It is important to add the proper command line switches for the
compression utilities. You must make sure that the programs are
not waiting for additional input such as a response to a Yes/No
prompt. When calling the archive program, FMail appends the
archive name and (when adding to an archive) the names of the
files to be added or (when extracting files) the name of the
directory where the extracted files should be placed. When you
need use another order, e.g. you need to put a switch between the
archive name and the name of the file to be added, you can use the
%a, %f and %p arguments. FMail will substitute %a by the name of
the archive, %f by the name of the file to be added or the
directory where extracted files should be placed and %p by the
path of a directory where temporary files can be stored (FMail
uses the FMail system directory for this purpose). IMPORTANT: when
you use for example %f, you also must use %a and vice versa,
because as soon as you use one of these arguments, FMail won't
automatically append archive and file info anymore! %p is normally
left out, because not many archivers require this.

The archiving utility listed behind "Default" is used for nodes
not listed in the Node Manager.

DOS versions only: For each of the compression programs you can
enter the minimum amount of memory that is required to run the
program. If the required amount is available, FMail won't swap
itself out of memory when it start a compression program. If you
enter 0, FMail will always swap itself out of memory (if swapping
is enabled).


3.4.7     Decompression and Decompression/32

The programs that are used to decompress your incoming mail
bundles are listed here. 32-bit versions of FMail use the
archivers listed in the Decompression/32 section. The
Decompression window has a special entry called GUS. The program
that is entered here is called by FMail when it can't determine
the type of the archive. For more information see section 3.4.6
(Compression).


3.5       Import/export

All menu options starting with "List" allow you to send
information about parts of your FMail setup to a text file,
printer, or other device. If you want to send it to the printer
(or other device), enter it's device name (e.g. PRN) instead of a
filename.


3.5.1     Import Config

The option "Import config" allows you to import AREAS.BBS,
FOLDER.FD and area and node configuration files of three other
popular echomail processors: IMAIL (version 1.20), TosScan and
GEcho. In some cases you have the choice whether to use the area

tag or to use the comment to identify an area in the config file
that is created by FSetup.

A special option is Import RA info. It imports RA security
information into an EXISTING FMail areas file. If you do not
already have an FMail areas file, enter the information manually
in the Area Manager or use one of the other import functions
first. When you start the Import RA info option, the program will
try to find security information in MESSAGES.RA for each area that
is defined in FMail.Ar and insert it in that file.


3.5.2     AutoExport

Normally when a new area is installed, this had to be done in a
number of programs. With FSetup's AutoExport feature this is no
longer necessary. Each update in the Area Manager can result in an
automatic update of AREAS.BBS, FOLDER.FD (FrontDoor), IMFOLDER.CFG
(InterMail), MESSAGES.RA (RemoteAccess), BOARDS.BBS (SuperBBS),
MSGCFG.DAT (QuickBBS) and a file in a format that can be used by
GoldED. All you have to do is to enter the path to the directory
in which the desired file should appear (the actual filename
should not be added; FSetup will append a standard name to the
path).

IMPORTANT: The AutoExport function will overwrite the existing
file, so ALL INFORMATION IN THAT FILE WILL BE LOST. For example,
areas defined in MESSAGES.RA that are not defined in FSetup will
be removed by AutoExport. That is the reason why local areas
should also be defined in FSetup: that way they will be exported
to MESSAGES.RA and other files.

With AREAS.BBS you may include pass-through areas by setting the
switch to 'Yes'.

With FOLDER.FD/IMFOLDER.CFG and the BBS area files you may choose
which item should be used: the area tag or the comment field. You
may include the Bad messages board, the Duplicate messages board
and the Recovery board in the BBS areas file by setting the
appropriate switch to 'Yes'. AutoExport will use some standard
settings for these areas: e.g. they will be Local and ReadOnly and
all security levels will be set to 32000.

The GoldEd file AREAS.GLD can be used by GoldEd if you insert the
following line as the last line in your GoldEd configuration file:
INCLUDE AREAS.GLD

In QuickBBS's MSGCFG.DAT the write security information will also
be used for the template security information.


3.6       Uplink Manager

The Uplink Manager is used to enter information about uplinks that
is needed by FMail to connect and disconnect echomail areas. You
can define up to 32 uplinks. The information that is needed for
each uplink will now be explained.

Uplink system

          The node number of the uplink.

AreaFix program

          The name of the program FMail should direct its request
          messages to. If you are not sure, try 'Areafix'. This
          will work in most cases.

AreaFix password

          The password you use to connect and disconnect echomail
          areas on this system.

Add '+' prefix

          If FMail should put a '+' in front of the area names it
          tries to connect. This is normally not necessary.

Authorized groups

          Authorized groups are groups a downlink has to have
          access to in order to be allowed to use the Forward
          Request feature for this uplink.

Unconditional

          If set to Yes, FMail doesn't check the Areas file listed
          below.

Areas file type

          If set to 'Random', FMail searches the entire file. If
          'Areas file type' is set to '<AREANAME> <DESCRIPTION>'
          FMail searches for area names at the beginning of each
          line only. Also it then uses the description to fill in
          the comment field in the Area Manager.
          A new format is BCL. Some tosser can send Binary
          Conference Listings to their download (one of which is
          FMail). FMail will automatically connect received BCL
          files to the right entry of the Uplink Manager if this
          switch is set to BCL.

          --- more BCL info ---

Areas file name

          Name of the file containing area names that should be
          checked by FMail. This file has to located in the same
          directory where the FMail executables are located or the
          directory that is pointed to by the FMAIL environment
          variable (if defined).

Origin address

          The address that should by used as the origin address of
          the request message.







3.7       Pack Manager

The syntax to be used for Pack Manager entries:

<node>... [EXCEPT <node>...] [VIA <node>|HOST] [/A] [/C] [/H]
[/I] [/L] [/O]

The one or more <node> entries before the optional VIA keyword
specify the nodes for which messages should be packed. The '*' and
'?' characters may be used here. '?' may be any digit. '*'
indicates that the rest of the node number may be anything. E.g.
2:283/* specifies all nodes in net 283 in zone 2. 2:283/6?0
specifies nodes 2:283/600, 610, 620, 630 etc. The wildcard '#' is
substituted by digits 0-9 in subsequent evaluations. If the VIA
node is 'HOST', the mail bundles will be sent to the net hosts.

The following switches may be used:

/A        Do not process AreaMgr requests

/C        Include messages with Crash status. Normally these
          messages will not be packed.

/H        Include messages with Hold status. Normally these
          messages will not be packed.

/O        Include orphaned messages. Normally these messages will
          not be packed.

/I        Only pack messages that are in transit. Normally all
          netmail messages destined for other nodes will be
          packed.

/L        Only pack messages that originated on your system.
          Normally all netmail messages destined for other nodes
          will be packed.

Entries in the Pack Manager are used from top to bottom: the first
entry that applies to a particular message will be used for that
message. An example:

2:282/357 2:282/309 via 2:282/301
2:283/216 via 2:283/203
1:* 2:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:* via 2:282/1

This example packs all messages for nodes 2:282/357, 2:282/309 and
2:282/301 and their points that do not have the crash, hold or
orphan status and sends them to node 2:282/301. Messages for
2:283/216 and 2:283/203 are packed and sent to node 2:283/203. All
remaining messages for zones 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be sent to
2:282/1.










3.8       Node Manager

The node manager is used to store information about the systems
you exchange mail with.

Sysop Name

          Here you may enter the name of the sysop of the remote
          system. The name of the sysop will be used in AreaMgr
          replies and to determine if a message should be sent to
          a system if that system is 'passive'. Only messages
          directed to the Sysop will be forwarded to such systems.

System

          The node number of a system. IMPORTANT: This node number
          should always be the normal node number i.e. you should
          NEVER enter a node number containing a fakenet. If it is
          necessary for some of your points that you send them
          their mail using a fakenet, you should set their
          capability to "Stone Age" (see below) and define a
          fakenet in the Addresses window.

Via system

          Address where to route mail for this system to. NOTE:
          the PKT files will be directed to the original AKA. Only
          the ARCmail bundle will be directed to the Via node, if
          specified.

Use AKA

          Which AKA should be used for mail bundles to this
          system. If set to AUTO, FMail automatically picks the
          best-matching AKA.

Groups

          The area manager lets you assign a group letter to each
          echo area. In the node manager you can enter the letters
          of the groups that are available to a particular system.

Write level

          If the write level of a system is less than the write
          level that is specified with an echo area in the Area
          Manager, then this system is not allowed to write
          messages in this area.

Compression

          The Compression toggle can be used to set the type of
          archiving program that will be used to compress mail for
          this system. A system is able to change this setting
          using an AreaMgr request message, if %COMPRESSION is
          allowed in the AreaMgr options.

Capability

          You can tell FMail whether or not the software of the
          other system recognizes 4-d addresses (FSC-0039) or only

          2-d addresses by setting the capability switch to "Type
          2+" for 4-d or "Stone Age" for 2-d. If you want to send
          mail to one of your "Stone Age" points, FMail will
          automatically try to use the fakenet method. In most
          cases setting the capability of a system to Type 2+ will
          be fine.

Attach status

          You may set the status of the file attach messages for a
          system to "None", "Hold", "Crash", "Hold/Direct",
          "Crash/Direct" and "Direct". Normally "None" is fine.
          Please see the manual of your mailer on how to handle
          mail bundles.

PKT path

          If you enter a path here, FMail will not compress the
          mail for this node, but store the PKT files in this
          directory.

E-mail

          E-mail address where the mail should be sent to if you
          are using FMail/Win32's SMTP option.

Active

          A system that is not active will not receive echomail
          for the connected areas except for messages that are
          directed to the Sysop name of that system. A system that
          has the Active set to No is still allowed to send
          echomail for connected areas. The Active status can be
          changed by the system through the %ACTIVE and %PASSIVE
          commands in a message to AreaMgr.

Notify

          Send a notify message to this system when the command
          'FTools Notify [/A] [/N]' is issued.

Pack netmail

          If enabled, the Pack Netmail switch causes netmail for
          this system to be packed for this system directly. This
          means, that mail for this system will not be routed
          according to the contents of the Pack Manager.

Forward requests

          The Forward request toggle is used to allow systems to
          use the Uplink Manager.

Allow rescan

          When a system connects a new area through an AreaMgr
          request, that system may also request to scan your
          message base for messages in that area. You can prevent
          a system from rescanning your message base by setting
          this switch to No. Previously, JAM rescanning was not
          available, however it is avilable in this release! The

          ^aRESCANNED kludge is added to messages which are
          rescanned.

Route point

          If the system you are editing in the Node Manager is one
          of your points, then if you enable this switch, FMail
          will check all messages directed to your AKAs to see
          whether they are meant for this point (by checking the
          To: name). If so, the message will be automatically
          forwarded.

Rem.maint (registered users only)

          Allow this system to perform remote maintenance. A
          system that is allowed to perform remote maintenance
          (e.g. your Co- Sysop) can connect and disconnect areas
          on behalf of other systems. A remote maintenance message
          has the same syntax as a normal AreaFix message, but
          also contains a %FROM command, followed by the node
          number for which the remote maintenance has to be
          performed. The password that should be used is the
          password of the system performing the request, not the
          password of the system behind the %FROM keyword.

Tiny SEEN-BYs

          If you set the "Tiny SEEN-BYs" switch to "Yes", this
          system will receive echo mail messages in which only you
          and your downlinks will be listed in the SEEN-BY lines.
          In normal situations this switch should be set to "No".

Reformat date

          Some echomail utilities create date strings which are
          not in accordance with the specifications. Some other
          echomail utilities have problems recognizing those date
          strings. FMail will send a corrected date string to a
          system if "Reformat date" is set to yes.

Auto BCL days

          If you set a value here, FMail automatically sends BCL
          files to this node. The value set indicates the number
          of days between two files. See page 27 for more
          information about this feature.

AreaMgr password

          The AreaMgr password is used by a remote system to
          connect or disconnect echomail areas. To do this, the
          remote system has to send a message to "AreaMgr",
          "AreaFix" or "FMail" at your node number. The password
          should be on the subject line.

Packet password

          If you enter an Packet password, FMail will only toss
          packets from this system if the listed password is
          present in the header of the received packet. The
          password also will be placed in the header of each

          packet created for this system. The combination of
          packet password and the Security option in the Area
          Manager should make it a bit more difficult to
          successfully drop an echomail bomb on your system.

Ignore

          If you want to put a password in packets you are sending
          to another system, but do not want to check packets you
          receive from that system for that password, you should
          toggle the Ignore switch to Yes.

AutoPassive days

          The system will automatically be set to the Passive
          status, if more days passed by since the last time new
          mail created than the number of days entered here.

AutoPassive size

          The system will automatically be set to the Passive
          status, if the size of the mail bundle exceeds the
          number of kb's entered here.

Settings in the Node Manager can be changed for more than one node
at once by means of the Global change function (F3). First you
change the desired fields. Those fields get an asterisk in front
of them meaning that those are the fields that will be updated in
the selected records. You can also turn the asterisk on and off by
means of the INS and DEL keys. When you are ready, press ESC. You
will then be prompted for a node string with wildcards. If you
want to change all nodes in zone 2, enter here 2:*. Use of ? is
also allowed.




























3.9       Area Manager

The area manager is used to tell FMail which echomail conferences
(areas) you are carrying. Use the left and right arrows to walk
through all areas. If you press F5, you will see a list of all
areas you have defined. Here you can walk through all areas by
pressing the up and down arrows.

Each of the fields of the Area Manager will now be explained in
detail.

Area name

          This is the name of the conference. It can be up to 50
          characters long. This name is often referred to as the
          area tag. It is inserted into every message that your
          system exports for an area so that other system's
          echomail processors can put the message into the correct
          area when it arrives.

Comment

          This field is used to give some info about an echomail
          area in messages that are returned by AreaMgr. It also
          appears in the output of some of the list functions in
          the Import/export menu.

JAM MB path

          Path of the JAM message base. If you enter a path name
          here, FMail will set the Hudson board number to None (if
          it was not set to that already).

Board

          The "Board" field is used to select the message base
          board number in which the messages in this area should
          be imported. If you select this option, a window pops up
          containing all possible board numbers and the word
          "None". The board numbers that are displayed in a dark
          colour are already used by another area. If you select
          the word "None" and the JAM MB path is left blank, the
          messages will not be imported into the message base, but
          only forwarded to your downlinks (a so called "Pass-
          through area"). Any other choice of board number will
          cause the JAM MB path field to be blanked. Use the
          cursor keys to go to the desired board number and press
          ENTER to select.

Write level

          If the write level of an area is greater than or equal
          to the write level that is specified with a system in
          the Node Manager, then this system is not allowed to
          write messages in this area.

Group

          The "Group" field defines which group a conference
          belongs to. The valid range for this field is A through
          Z. It's used to regulate the availability of conferences

          to other systems. You should divide your conferences
          into a number of categories. For example, all
          conferences that only a few people should be able to
          access could be put into group S for Secure while all
          other conferences are put into G for General.

Local

          If you have local message areas in your message base,
          you should enter those areas in FSetup with Local set to
          Yes. That way, you can enter message base maintenance
          information for that area and make sure, that the
          boardnumber cannot be accidentally assigned to another
          area. Also those areas will be marked as Local in
          AutoExported files.

Areafix

          Allow your downlinks to connect to and disconnect from
          this area by sending messages to AreaFix or FMail.
          Normally this switch should be set to Yes.

Active

          If the 'Active' switch is off, the area will no longer
          be recognized by FMail as a valid echomail area. This
          switch can be used to temporarily disable a particular
          area.

BBS info

          Here you may enter the security level and flags and
          other information that will be used in the area file of
          your BBS program.

Use SeenBy

          Normally FMail only uses the address in the packet
          header to determine to which systems a message in a
          particular area should be forwarded: a message is
          forwarded to all systems listed in the export list in
          the Area Manager. If Use SeenBy is enabled, a message
          also will not be forwarded to systems listed in the
          SEEN-BY lines of that message.

Tiny SeenBy

          If set to "Yes", all of your downlinks that are
          connected to this area will receive messages in which
          the SEEN-BY lines will contain only your downlinks.

Imp. SeenBy

          If set to "Yes", SEEN-BY information of messages in this
          conference will be imported into the message base.

Security

          Only messages from systems that are connected to a
          particular conference are accepted by FMail. For
          example, suppose you carry an area called FMAIL_HELP and

          you have enabled Security for that area. If you receive
          an echomail message from some system and that system was
          not listed in the export list of FMAIL_HELP, that
          message will be tossed into the bad messages board (if
          defined).

Private

          If the "Private" field is set to "Yes", private message
          are allowed in this conference. Otherwise, the private
          bit will be removed from all messages in this
          conference.

# Messages

          Maximum number of messages in an area. If there are more
          messages in an area, they will be deleted as soon as
          FTools Maint /d is used.

# Days old

          If there are messages in an area that are older than the
          number of days that is entered here, they will be
          deleted as soon as FTools Maint /d is used.

# Days rcvd

          If there are received messages (i.e. messages that have
          been read by the person they are addressed to) in an
          area that are older than the number of days that is
          entered here, they will be deleted as soon as FTools
          Maint /d is used.

Arrival date

          Use the date that a message arrived on your system
          instead of the date that a message was written when
          deleting messages using the # Days. This option does not
          work with messages with an extremely long subject line.
          For these messages the date that the message was written
          will be used.

Keep SysOp

          Do not remove any message that has not been read by the
          Sysop (the user with the first entry in Users.BBS). If
          this switch is set to Yes, no message that has not been
          read by the SysOp will be deleted, if it should be
          deleted according to one or more of the other criteria.

Origin AKA

          The origin is the address that will be added to the PATH
          and SEEN-BY lines. It will also used in the origin line
          that will be appended by FMail if the message that is
          exported from the message base does not contain an
          origin line (NOTE: FMail will NEVER add tear and/or
          origin lines to messages that are received from other
          systems in case they are missing).


Other AKAs

          If you want to add more than one of your AKAs to the
          SEEN-BY lines of a message, you should use the "Other
          AKAs" options to indicate which AKAs should be added
          also.

Origin line

          If a message that is exported out of the message base
          does not contain a origin line, FMail will add one. This
          added origin will contain a text string that may be
          entered here.

Export

          The systems connected to the conference are listed in a
          window which pops up when you select the option
          "Connected systems". IMPORTANT: The node number should
          always be the normal node number i.e. you should NEVER
          enter a node number containing a fakenet. FMail
          automatically uses the fakenet if necessary. The maximum
          number of systems on the Export list is 64.

Settings in the Area Manager can be changed for more than one node
at once by means of the Global change function (F3). First you
change the desired fields. Those fields get an asterisk in front
of them meaning that those are the fields that will be updated in
the selected records. You can also turn the asterisk on and off by
means of the INS and DEL keys. When you are ready, press ESC. You
will then be prompted for the groups for which the selected fields
should be changed.





























4         FMail



The actual FMail program has four main commands. They are "Scan",
"Toss", "Import" and "Pack" and will be discussed in detail below.


4.1       Scan

Scan the message base for outgoing echomail and netmail messages.
Echomail messages will be packed to be sent to other systems.
Netmail messages will be moved to the netmail directory. They may
be packed later by the FMail Pack command discussed below.

The Scan option can be used in combination with six switches:

          /A   Do not process AreaMgr requests
          /E   Scan for echomail messages only
          /N   Scan for netmail messages only
          /H   Scan Hudson base only
          /J   Scan JAM base only
          /S   Scan the entire message base (ignore
               ECHOMAIL.BBS/JAM and NETMAIL.BBS/JAM)

ATTENTION: FMail's SCAN function does not support netmail credits.


4.2       Toss

Tosses received mail bundles into the message base and forwards
echomail messages to your downlinks.

If FMail Toss seems to be returning messages to the system they
were coming from, please check if the address listed on the
'Processing...' line when tossing, is the same address as the one
that is listed in the Export list of the echoes concerned.

The /A switch tells FMail to ingnore AreaMgr requests.

The /B switch may be added to let FMail check all messages in the
bad messages directory to see whether they are valid echomail
messages or not. This may necessary if you are receiving a new
conference from your uplink but forgot to enter it in the area
manager. Messages that are moved to the message base using the /B
switch will not be sent to your downlinks as this may cause
duplicate messages to be sent into the net.



4.3       Import

Imports netmail messages destined for your system into the message
base. A netmail board should be defined in FSetup. Whether or not
messages to the Sysop should be imported can also be defined in
FSetup. The /A switch tells FMail to ingnore AreaMgr requests.





4.4       Pack

Packs and compresses netmail messages. These messages may be
routed through a specified system or may be sent directly.

The syntax of FMail Pack:

          FMail Pack  [ <node>...
                        [EXCEPT <node>...]
                        [VIA <node>|HOST]
                        [/A] [/C] [/H] [/I] [/L] [/O]
                      ]


This syntax is the same as the syntax of Pack Manager entries and
is described in section 3.7. If the command line does not contain
any node numbers, the information stored in FSetup's Pack Manager
will be used. Packing messages is not required (but sometimes
useful) in e.g. a FrontDoor environment. It _is_ required in a
Binkley/PoP environment.

The /A switch tells FMail to ingnore AreaMgr requests.


4.4.1     Examples

FMail Pack 2:282/301 2:283/203 VIA HOST

               Packs mail for nodes 2:282/301 and 2:283/203 and
               points of these nodes and sends it to the host of
               these systems (2:282/0 and 2:283/0).

FMail Pack 2:282/1.1 /C

               Packs mail for point 2:282/1.1 and sends it
               directly to that point. Messages with the Crash
               status will also be packed.



4.5       MGR

FMail Mgr only scans the netmail directory and processes AreaMgr
requests found in that directory.




















5         AreaMgr



AreaMgr is a built-in function of FMail that allows other systems
to connect or disconnect echomail areas by simply sending a
netmail message.

This netmail message should be addressed to one of your AKAs and
directed to 'AreaMgr' or 'FMail'. For compatibility reasons the
message may also be directed to 'AreaFix', 'AreaLink' or
'EchoMgr'. Instead of the normal subject, a password should be
entered. For each system that will be allowed to send AreaMgr
messages to your, you should create an entry in the node manager
containing a password.

The message body of an AreaMgr request contains the requested
mutations in connected echomail areas. To connect to area
TEST_AREA you just enter that name followed by the ENTER key. To
disconnect from an area, just put a minus '-' before the area tag.

The format of an AreaLink request:

   By: <your name>
   To: AreaMgr (<node number of dest node>)
   Re: <AreaMgr password>
   St: Pvt

                                   by FMail will be sent to both
                                   the system doing remote
                                   maintenance and the system for
                                   which the maintenance is being

When FMail processes an AreaMgr request message, it will generate
a reply, containing the result of the request. This reply will
look like this:

6         FTools



FTools is the message base maintenance program that comes with
FMail.

FTools is e.g. used to remove old messages from the message base
and the display information about the message base. FTools can be
divided into four parts, which will be discussed below.

ATTENTION: The FTools functions that use the Hudson message base
do NOT allow message base sharing. FTools will not run if either
FMail, FSetup or another copy of FTools is active.

Everywhere below where <board> is mentioned, you may use the area
tag of the area. In some cases it also is allowed to use the
Hudson board number. For the netmail board of the main AKA use
#NETM, for netmail board of for example AKA 5 use #NET5. For the
netmail directory use #NETDIR. For the Bad messages board, the
Recovery board and the Duplicate messages board, you can use #BAD,
#REC and #DUP.



6.1       Maint

The most important function of FTools is message base maintenance.
If started without any switches, FTools Maint only updates the
reply chains and recreates the index files.
Additional features are available by using command line switches:

/H        Process Hudson base only

/J        Process JAM message bases only

/Q        Process only JAM areas in which messages have been
          tossed

/C        Recover messages in undefined boards (Hudson only). This
          means that messages in message base boards that are not
          defined in the Area Manager will be moved to the
          recovery board, if that board was defined in FSetup.
          IMPORTANT: If no recovery board number was defined,
          those messages will be deleted! So please make sure,
          that your non-echomail boards are also defined in the
          Area Manager, with the Active switch set to No.

/D        Delete messages using the information in the Area
          Manager. See section 3.9 for more information about the
          criteria that may be used to delete messages.

/N        Renumber the message base (Hudson only). All messages in
          the message base will be renumbered. The first message
          will become message #1 etc.

/P        Pack (remove deleted messages) (Hudson only). When a
          message in the message base is deleted, the actual
          message is still present in the message base. It will
          only be marked as being deleted. In order to keep the
          message base size within reasonable limits, the message

          base has to be packet regularly, i.e. deleted messages
          are removed from the message base.

/R        Remove "Re:" from subject lines. Some editors put "Re:"
          in front of the actual subject line, when a reply is
          written. This switch allows you to remove it.

/T        Fix bad text length info in MsgHdr.BBS, which might
          cause some BBS programs or mail editors to crash (Hudson
          only).

/U        Undelete deleted messages. Deleted messages cannot be
          undeleted after the message base has been packed (Hudson
          only).

/X        Delete messages with bad dates or bad board number
          (Hudson only).

/B        Keep .BAK files. This switch only has effect if it is
          used in combination with /P and if the Overwrite mode is
          not used.

/F        Force Overwrite mode (Hudson only). This switch only has
          effect is used in combination with /P.

/O        Use Overwrite mode if there is not enough disk space
          available to create backup files (Hudson only). This
          switch only has effect is used in combination with /P.

In most cases the following command can be used:

               FTOOLS MAINT /D /P /N /R /O


6.2       Delete

To delete all messages in a particular board in the message base,
enter

               FTools Delete <board>

6.3       Undelete

To undelete all deleted messages in a particular board in the
message base, enter: FTools Undelete <board number>


6.4       Post

The general syntax of the Post command is:

          FTools Post [<file|-] <area tag>
               [-from xxx] [-to xxx] [-dest xxx] [-subj xxx] [-aka
               x]
               [/C] [/H] [/D] [/K] [/P] [/R] [/F] [/E] [/T]

<area tag> can be one of the following:
          -    The area tag of the desired echomail area.
          -    #netdir for the Netmail directory.
          -    #netm for the Netmail board of your main aka.

          -    #net1-#net31 for the Netmail boards of your akas
               1 - 31.

Available options with default value which are used if the options
is omitted:

          [-from xxx]    From name, default is the SysOp name as
                         defined in FSetup
          [-to xxx]      To name, default is 'SysOp'.
          [-subj xxx]    Subject line, default is the name of that
                         file that was posted.
          [-dest xxx]    Node to send the message to (netmail
                         only).
          [-aka x]            The AKA that should be used as the
                              origin address (netmail only).
          [/C]                     Crash status (netmail only).
          [/H]                     Hold status (netmail only).
          [/D]                     Direct status (netmail only).
          [/K]                     Delete message after sending
                                   it.
          [/P]                     Private status.
          [/R]                     File Request (netmail only).
          [/F]                     File attach (netmail only)
          [/E]                     Erase sent file (file attach
                                   only)\n"
          [/T]                     Truncate sent file (file attach
                                   only)\n"

Two examples:

To send a file EXAMPLE.TXT as an echomail message in area
FMAIL_HELP, enter:

          FTools Post EXAMPLE.TXT FMAIL_HELP -subj "This is an
          example"

To send a file EXAMPLE.TXT as a netmail message with the file
attached to node 2:283/619, enter

          FTools Post EXAMPLE.TXT #netdir -to "Folkert Wijnstra"
               -dest 2:283/619 /F


6.5       Export

To export messages in a particular Hudson board to a text file,
you can use the FTools Export command. The general syntax of the
Export command is:

          FTools export <board name> <file name> [/D] [/F] [/T]
          [/S] [/X] [/P] [/K]


6.6       Move

To move messages from one board to another board in the message
base, enter

          FTools Move <old board> <new board>


6.7       Sort

To sort messages in the Hudson message base that have not been
read yet, enter

          FTools Sort

To sort all messages in the message base, add /A. WARNING: After
sorting the message base with the /A switch, the lastread pointers
will not be valid any more. This switch should NOT be used on BBS
systems.


6.8       Stat

To display message base statistics which also will be written to
the log file, enter

               FTools Stat


6.9       Notify

To send a notify message to all systems in the Node Manager that
have the notify switch set to Yes, enter

          Ftools Notify [/A] [/N]

          [/A] Send an Area Status report
          [/N] Send a Node Status report

To send a notify message to for example 2:283/619, enter

          FTools Notify 2:283/619 [/A] [/N]


6.10      MsgM

In the current version of FTools, the .MSG maintenance function
only contains the renumber function. The syntax is:

          FTools MsgM [-net] [-sent] [-rcvd] [-pmail] /N

          [-net]                   Netmail directory
          [-sent]             Sent messages directory
          [-rcvd]             Received messages directory
          [-pmail]            Personal mail directory

IMPORTANT: don't renumber the netmail directory while FrontDoor is
active.



6.11      Addnew

Automatically add new areas detected during FMail Toss to the
FMAIL.AR. FMail will use the default settings defined in the
AreaMgr defaults section of FSetup. A name for JAM areas is
generated automatically.

APPENDIX A     -    Error messages



Below some of FMail's error messages are listed with a brief
explanation.

Bad node in pack list

               There was a syntax error in the list of nodes that
               should be packed.

Bad VIA node

               There was a syntax error in the node number after
               the optional VIA keyword.

Can't forward area xxx to a local AKA

               You are using one of your own AKAs in the export
               list of the listed area. Exporting an area to one
               of your own AKAs is not allowed.

Can't lock the message base for update

               FMail couldn't lock the message base for update in
               a multiline environment. If after several retries
               this message doesn't go away, reboot your computer,
               because some program may have locked the message
               base without unlocking it when it was finished.

Can't read FMAIL.CFG

               FMail could not find FMAIL.CFG in the directory
               where the currently running executable in located.

Can't send mail to more than 256 nodes in one run

               You have used more than 256 different export
               addresses in the export lists of your echomail
               areas.

Can't update the message base files

               When running in Message base sharing mode, FMail
               could not append the shadow message base (MSG*.FML
               files) to the actual message base files. Probable
               causes are:
               -    The message base is locked. Try resetting your
                    computer.
               -    The message base has reached its maximum size.
                    Use FTools Maint /D /P to reduce its size.
               -    The highest message number has been reached.
                    Use FTools Maint /N to renumber the message
                    base.

Disk-related error

               FMail has a problem reading or writing some file.
               This might be caused by a full disk.

ERROR: ....

               Please contact the author! In case of the message
               'Not enough file handles available' try using a
               higher number in the FILES= command in CONFIG.SYS
               first.

FMail requires at least DOS 3.3

               Some functions of FMail require the presence of DOS
               3.3 or higher. DR DOS should also work.

Highest allowed message number has been reached

               The highest allowed message number in the Hudson
               message base (32768) has been reached. Use FTools
               Maint /N to renumber the message base.

Main nodenumber not defined in FSetup

               You should always define the main node number in
               FSetup; FMail will not work without one!

Maximum message base size has been reached

               The size of the Hudson message base file MSGTXT.BBS
               has reached its limit of 16 Mb. Use FTools Maint /D
               /P to delete old messages. If you have enabled
               FMail's multi-line option, the error message means
               that MSGTXT.FML has reached the 16 Mb limit.

Packet is addressed to another node

               A PKT file is not addressed to your main node
               number or to one of your AKAs.

Packet password security violation

               A PKT file contained a wrong password or no
               password at all, although a password was set for
               the source node in the node manager.

Received password "xxx" from node x:x/x.x, expected "yyy"

               A packet from node x:x/x.x contained password xxx,
               but password yyy was entered in the Node Manager.

Unexpected password "xxx" from node x:x/x.x

               A packet from node x:x/x.x contained password xxx,
               but that password was not entered in the Node
               Manager.

Warning: Fakenet not defined but required for AKA x

               You are trying to send mail to a point system,
               which was configured in the Node Manager as being a
               "Stone Age" system, and thus requiring a fakenet
               number which was not defined. There are two
               possible solutions:

               -    Set the Capability of the point system to Type
                    2+ if that system is using an echomail
                    processor that can handle Type 2+ packets.
               -    If the echomail processor of the point system
                    can't handle Type 2+ packets, you have to
                    assign a fakenet number to the AKA that is
                    used for that particular point. See paragraph
                    3.3.6 for more information.

Warning: Node xxx is not defined in the Node Manager

               You are trying to send mail to a node which is not
               listed in the Node Manager. As a consequence, FMail
               does not know what the capability of the remote
               system is, which compression program should be used
               and status the resulting file attach message should
               have. If this is the case, FMail will use default
               values.











































APPENDIX B     -    Technical notes



*         The FTSC assigned product code for FMail is 0x81 (129
          decimal).

*         The standard DOS version of FMail can handle up to 512
          echomail conferences (4096 for the DPMI and 32-bit
          versions) of which up to 200 may be imported into the
          Hudson message base.

*         FMail can handle up to 256 downlinks.

*         FMail supports up to 32 AKAs.

*         FMail is fully zone and point aware.

*         Maximum message size is 45 kb (DOS version) or 9999 kb
          (32 bits DOS/DPMI, Windows and OS/2 version).

*         The mail packets created by FMail are FTS-0001, FTS-0004
          and FSC-0039 compatible, using the Type 2+ packet header
          and the Capability Word. FMail also recognizes Type 2.2
          (FSC-0045) packet headers.

*         If an AREA: tag is preceded by a ^A, it is still
          recognized by FMail. Also tags in lower case are
          recognized.

*         SEEN-BY and PATH lines are created and updated and are
          optionally used by FMail for duplicate prevention
          purposes (the PATH lines are not used by FMail).

*         FMail can parse both Fido/Opus and SEAdog style date
          fields.

*         FMail supports the RemoteAccess/FrontDoor Hudson Message
          Base sharing specifications.

*         FMail was written in C and compiled using Borland C++
          Version 4.52. The DPMI version was compiled using
          Borland C++ Version 4.52 and Borland Powerpack for DOS
          Version 1.5. The OS/2 version was compiled using Borland
          C++ for OS/2 1.0.

*         File input/output is performed using standard DOS file
          handle calls.

*         The DOS versions of FMail, FSetup and FTools
          automatically detect the video environment and write
          directly to the screen or DESQview screen buffer.

*         The implementation of the Binary Conference Listing
          system is based upon FSC-0057 rev. 3.

*         FMail returns one of the following errorlevels:

               50   Message base is full
               5    Possible mail bomb detected
               4    Error in configuration files

               3    Control-break pressed
               2    Insufficient memory available
               1    Insufficient disk space available or disk
                    error
               0    No errors occurred
