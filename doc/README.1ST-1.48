NEW KEY SYSTEM
==============
In January 1999, a new key system has been introduced. FMail 1.48 accepts
the new key file but also still works with the current keys (although
you can't enter them in FSetup anymore). IMPORTANT: if you register FMail
from now on, you should receive one key file and no longer two numeric keys.

There will be a free automatic update procedure for original keys soon
(probably in June). The original keys will be valid in this version of
FMail until September 1st 1999. Please see the FMail pages on the Internet
or request NEWKEY from my system for more information about the key conversion.


IF YOU ARE USING A VERSION OF FMAIL EARLIER THAN 1.46
=====================================================
Please make a backup of both data files AND program files first before
installing this new version! The layout of the config files has changed,
so if you want to go back to a version before 1.42g after installing 1.48,
you should restore the original config files as well.


MIXING DPMI 16/32 VERSIONS
==========================
The FMail DPMI package contains both 16 bit and 32 bit versions. Running
those versions at the same time may cause problems. So don't try to start
FSetup (16 bit) and FMailX32 or FToolsX32 at the same time.


WHICH FMAIL TO USE
==================
Standard DOS version:   If you run a 8086 or 80286 computer or if you have
                        a 80386 computer or higher and you don't carry too
                        many echomail areas.
DPMI version:           If you use a 80386 computer or higher and carry
                        more areas than the standard version can handle.
                        The DPMI version comes in two flavours: 16 bit DPMI
                        and 32 bit DPMI. The 32 bit version can handle more
                        areas and has better dupe detection facilities.
                        Sometimes this version causes problems. In that case
                        you could try using the 16 bit version.
Windows/32 version      If you run FMail under Windows/95 or NT.
OS/2 version:           if you run FMail under OS/2.


GOLDBASE
========
The GoldBase version of FMail uses the QUICK environment variable to locate
the NETMAIL.DAT and ECHOMAIL.DAT files.
