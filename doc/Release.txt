This file contains information about FMail releases since 1.60.GPL


2017-02-06  -  2.0.0.0

  This release has the "big" version bump to 2.0, because all the three modules
  are now compiled with the MingW32 windows compiler. MingW32 is in their own
  words: "MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", is a minimalist
  development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications." It's a
  free modern compiler, derived from the gnu c compiler, which is more or less
  the standard compiler on Linux.

  As my development environment I'm using Code::Blocks
  <http://www.codeblocks.org/>. The 3 .cbp files are the Code::Blocks project
  files for the 3 modules.

  I think this is a big step, hence the version bump, and an important move
  towards Linux compatibility. We are not there yet, but it's next on my agenda.

  Besides the MingW compatibility of the source code, the main new features are:
  - Using the FTSCPROD.nnn files, as published by the ftsc, for translating the
    product code in pkt files to product names in the log, instead of the
    internal table.
  - BCL reports: On receipt of a BCL file from your links, a report netmail
    with either the full content of the BCL file, or the changes since the last
    one can be generated.
  - Inbound and outbound .pkt file backups.
  - Lots of other small features and bug fixes, which you can read about in
    the ChangeLog file.


2016-09-18  -  1.72.0.0

  Only 1 month after the last release this time. ;)

  You can download it from the Sourceforge website here:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/fmail/files/FMail/1.72/

  I decided to slightly change the version numbering. Beta versions will have an
  uneven second number, and releases an even number. So you won't get releases
  with a high 3th, and even higher 4th (build) number. That's why there is the
  little jump in version numbers this time.

  There's only one major new function in this release, and that is the
  PING/TRACE function. You can read about the smaller changes and bug fixes in
  the ChangeLog file.


2016-08-16  -  1.69

  Release of FMail 1.69.

  More then 2 years after the last release, 1.69 has been released!

  You can download it from the Sourceforge website here:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/fmail/files/FMail/1.69/

  Lots of changes in this release. If you are interested in the complete list,
  you can read about them in detail in the 'ChangeLog' file in the zip archive
  after you download it.

  The most notable changes are:

  * FSetup Win32 version: FConfigW32.exe
  * Via kludge shows milliseconds and time in UTC and is more FTS-4009
    compliant.
  * RESCANNED kludge now has the same format as the VIA kludge.
  * Add a Via line as regular kludge line to messages tossed to the dupe area.
  * Also add Via kludge on received/tossed net mails.
  * 'Tiny Path' option.
  * Jam-maint function rewritten: uses memory buffers, for faster operation, and
    fixed file lock bug.
  * 'Allow Rescan' option for echo mail areas.
  * FMail log style added: Print "Active" time with millisecond precision.
  * Detect old messages (setting in days in FSetup) and move them to the bad
    area on detection.


2014-07-01  -  1.68

  I have released a new version of FMail (1.68).

  Only the Win32 version has been created. You can download it from sourceforge
  here:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmail/files/FMail/1.68/FMailW32-1.68.10.91.gpl.zip/download

  http://tinyurl.com/n97gnx4
  http://preview.tinyurl.com/n97gnx4

  The most important change since the last release is: FMail can now put plain
  uncompressed .pkt files in it's outbound destinations, if you select 'None' as
  compressor for nodes.

  But there are a lot more changes and fixes. For the full list see the
  ChangeLog file inside the zip release file.


2014-03-21  -  1.67

  I have released a new version of FMail (1.67).

  For now, only the Win32 version has been created. You can download it from sourceforge here:

  http://preview.tinyurl.com/okkonol
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmail/files/FMail/1.67/FMailW32-1.67.1.47.gpl.zip

  If you need any one of the other versions (DOS, 386, ...) please let me know and I see what I can do...

  Changes since the last release are:

  2014-03-21  1.67.1.47
    * Fixed some high ASCII usage.
    * Print seconds in header of toss summary.

  2013-12-30  1.67.0.45
    * Disk free space calculation uses 64 bit integers. The standard 32 bit integers aren't big enough to hold todays big disk sizes.
      This also fixes the bug where the 'Sent to node' report wasn't always written to the log when tossing.
    * Print free disk space to log file when calculated.
    * Write dates in log files in iso format (YYYY-MM-DD).
    * Updated products code list to FTSCPROD.016.
    * Toss logging is more compact: uses less newlines.
    * On WIN32 printed version string now has 4 digits.
    * Lots of cosmetic code changes, and a few little fixes.


2013-10-15  -  1.66

  I have released a new version of FMail (1.66).

  For now, only the Win32 version has been created. You can download it from sourceforge here:

  http://goo.gl/IAJxKN
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmail/files/FMail/1.66/FMailW32-1.66.0.33.gpl.zip

  If you need any one of the other versions (DOS, 386, ...) please let me know and I see what I can do...

  The main latest changes are:

  - Sort SEEN-BY list before usage. This fixes a bug where exporting didn't function properly when SEEN-BY's were used.
  - -aka Option can now be used while posting to an echomail area.
  - Completely removed key checking code. FMail (with or without a key file) should behave as a registered version.

  But there are more little changes and some bug fixes. You can read the complete list here:

2011-09-11

  FToolsW32 is now also compiled with C++ Builder 6. Watch the name change from:
  FToolsW3.exe to: FToolsW32.exe. So either adapt your batch files or rename it
  back! You should be carefull when you use this version of FTools, make sure
  you make backups of your message base files before you use it. I didn't test
  every function of FTools, just the ones that I use on my system:

   MAINT /D /N /O /P
   MSGM -net -sent -rcvd /N
   Notify /A
   Post ... <to JAM area>

   So be extra carefull when you use other functions of FTools!


2011-09-03  -  1.64.GPL

  This release of FMailW32 1.64.GPL should be regarded as a Beta!

  There are 2 important changes from the previous release:

  1) FMailW32.exe is now build with Borland C++ Builder 6, which is a bit more
  modern then Borland C++ 4.52 (1995 vs 2002). The main advantage for
  development is that BCB6 is able to debug Win32 programs, which BC45 was not.

  2) FMailW32 creates files and directory names in lowercase as much as
  possible, so it should function a bit better where files are on a filesystem
  that is case sensitive. Like my setup where fmail runs on virtual Windows, and
  binkd runs on the linux side of the machine.

  For the other tools in the FMail package you should still use those from the
  previous release, because they are not converted yet!

  Please let me know your experience with this release, in the fidonet
  FMAIL_HELP echomail area.

2008-02-12  -  1.60.GPL

  This is the opensource release of FMail 1.60.GPL. You will find a copy of the
  GPL license as the file COPYING in this release.

  FMail was compiled using the Borland C++ 4.52 compiler. In order to compile
  the DPMI versions, you need the Borland Power Pack.

  If you install Borland C++ in C:\Program fies\BC45\ and extract this archive
  in D:\FMail, you should be able to open the IDE file and compile FMail.

  If you have questions, please post them on the Sourceforge project space:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmail/

  Or try your luck by contacting Folkert at the e-mail address listed on
  http://fmail.nl.eu.org
