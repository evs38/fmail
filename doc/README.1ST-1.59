FMAIL 1.59c/beta
================
In this version the following problems have been fixed:
- Problem with the Addnew function
- Problem with the date routines in FTools that caused some messages to be
  deleted too early.
- and a few minor problems...

This version 1.59c is a public beta version. This means that you have to be
extra careful if you want to use this program. The doc files have NOT been
updated yet! This will be done when the normal version is released. At that
time, also a new beta will be released. In that beta version, it will be
possible to assign JAM bases to the netmail, bad, dup and recovery boards.


NEW KEY SYSTEM
==============
In January 1999, a new key system has been introduced. FMail 1.59 only
accepts the new key file. IMPORTANT: if you register FMail from now on,
you should receive one key file and no longer two numeric keys. You should
put the key file in the directory where the FMail config files are
located.

There is a free automatic update procedure for original keys. Please see
the FMail pages on the Internet for more information about the key conversion:
http://www.fmail.nl.eu.org. If you don't have access to the Internet, please
send me both original keys and the SysOp name by netmail. Allow about a week
for processing. Then poll my system again for the key file.


ABOUT Y2K
=========
As far as I know, there are no significant problems concerning the year 2000
problem in FMail. However, I cannot guarantee that there will be no problems
at all. There also may be problems that are caused by the compiler and the
libraries that come with it. If problems should occurs, please let me know
as soon as possible. I will then try to fix it as fast as I can.


IF YOU ARE USING A VERSION OF FMAIL EARLIER THAN 1.46
=====================================================
Please make a backup of both data files AND program files first before
installing this new version! The layout of the config files has changed,
so if you want to go back to a version before 1.42g after installing 1.59,
you should restore the original config files as well.


MIXING DPMI 16/32 VERSIONS
==========================
The FMail DPMI package contains both 16 bit and 32 bit versions. Running
those versions at the same time may cause problems. So don't try to start
FSetup (16 bit) and FMailX32 or FToolsX32 at the same time.


WHICH FMAIL TO USE
==================
Standard DOS version:   If you run a 8086 or 80286 computer or if you have
                        a 80386 computer or higher and you don't carry too
                        many echomail areas.
DPMI version:           If you use a 80386 computer or higher and carry
                        more areas than the standard version can handle.
                        The DPMI version comes in two flavours: 16 bit DPMI
                        and 32 bit DPMI. The 32 bit version can handle more
                        areas and has better dupe detection facilities.
                        Sometimes this version causes problems. In that case
                        you could try using the 16 bit version.
Windows/32 version      If you run FMail under Windows/95 or NT.
OS/2 version:           if you run FMail under OS/2.


GOLDBASE
========
The GoldBase version of FMail uses the QUICK environment variable to locate
the NETMAIL.DAT and ECHOMAIL.DAT files.
