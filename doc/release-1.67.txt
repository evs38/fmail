I have released a new version of FMail (1.67).

For now, only the Win32 version has been created. You can download it from sourceforge here:

If you need any one of the other versions (DOS, 386, ...) please let me know and I see what I can do...

Changes since the last release are:

2014-03-21  1.67.1.47
  * Fixed some high ASCII usage.
  * Print seconds in header of toss summary.

2013-12-30  1.67.0.45
  * Disk free space calculation uses 64 bit integers. The standard 32 bit integers aren't big enough to hold todays big disk sizes.
    This also fixes the bug where the 'Sent to node' report wasn't always written to the log when tossing.
  * Print free disk space to log file when calculated.
  * Write dates in log files in iso format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  * Updated products code list to FTSCPROD.016.
  * Toss logging is more compact: uses less newlines.
  * On WIN32 printed version string now has 4 digits.
  * Lots of cosmetic code changes, and a few little fixes.
