UPGRADE INFORMATION:
====================

If you currently are using an FMail version between 1.02 and 1.46,
do the following:
- Backup you config files and your executables.
- Copy the new executables over the old ones.
- Start FSetup and go into the Area Manager and the Node
  Manager. Save changes when exiting.

IMPORTANT: Some programs that access the FMail config files may
not be able to do so any more after the upgrade. With the AutoExport
feature, you can export FMail config files in the old 1.02 format
to another directory thus enabling other programs to keep working
properly.


NEW FEATURES IN FMAIL 1.48
==========================
- Problems with the AutoBCL areafix command have been fixed
- The Windows version is now optimized for Pentium processors (and up) and
  won't run om i486 processors anymore
- Dups are not tossed in the Bad messages area anymore
- The TOSS /B command works again
- Some problems in the export to GoldEd (AREAS.GLD) have been fixed
- If a mail bundle is locked, FMail will now create a new bundle instead
  of displaying an error message.


NEW FEATURES IN FMAIL 1.42g/1.44/1.46
=====================================

FMail 1.46 contains a fix for a problem with the key system that mainly
affected unregistered users. Also it contains a fixed OS/2 version. The
new features in FMail 1.42g/1.44 were:

- The Windows/32 version can send mail directly thru the Internet
- GoldEd AutoExport files are now exported correctly (R/O Loc flags)
- The import of BACKBONE.NA is now case insensitive
- FSetup now uses less memory!
- FMailX32 now runs archivers correctly again (fixed compiler bug)
- Max number of nodes is now 1024 in DPMI versions and 32 bit versions
- FSetup2 Netmail boards buffer problem fixed (compiler bug)
- Nodes now can be made read/only, write/only or locked. In the Area Manager
  Exports list you can set nodes to Read Only by pressing R, to Write Only
  by pressing W and to Locked (both read and write not allowed) by pressing L.


SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT NEW FEATURES IN FMAIL 1.40g
======================================================

FMail
=====
- The message size is now variable (32 bit versions only).
  See FSetup->Mail options.
- There now is a QuickBBS Goldbase version available.
  The message base maintenance features of FTools are not available
  in the Goldbase version.
- You can change the time out period that is used when two copies of
  FMail are started (previously it was  30 seconds). See FSetup, System info,
  Miscellaneous
- FMail can now create a list of all areas in which mail has been tossed.
  See FSetup, Micellaneous, Message base
- If you place a file called AREAMGR.TXT in the FMail directory,
  the contents of that file will be appended to areafix messages.
- The New Bundle date field is now updated correctly.
- The 'Use AKA' field in the node manager now has also effect on the
  origin address of echomail messages.
- Long file names are now supported for JAM areas. You have to enable it
  in FSetup: System info->Miscellaneous. Please make sure that the drive
  that you use for JAM supports long file names, as the internal checking
  isn't optimal yet.
- I've taken a special safety measure in the JAM code. If some of the JAM
  pointers are not correct, a seek operation may occur that causes the file
  file to get very large. Such a seek operation now isn't executed anymore,
  but displays the message "Illegal Seek operation".
  IMPORTANT: for the export of area information to a BBS program, you should
  set the flag "BBS export" in the BBS info section to Yes.
- Auto JAM path creation. FMail will generate a unique name for new JAM
  areas.
- The '=' command can now be used in Areafix messages to rescan an area
  without having to disconnect it first.
- FMail can generate Binary Conference Listings. Downlinks can request such a
  BCL file by using the command %BLIST in Areafix requests. In the Uplink
  Manager you can specify that an uplink can send BCL's. FMail will then
  automatically move received BCL files to the config directory and
  change the file entry in the Uplink Manager. See the included file
  FSC-0057.003 for more information.
  NEW SWITCH: Uplink Areas List in the Mgr Options menu. Currently this
  only works for BCL files. In future, it will be available for the
  <AREANAME> <DESCRIPTION> files as well.
- Variable number of links per echomail area (is now 64).
- JAR supporthas been added! Suggested formats are for compression
  "JAR.EXE a -y" and for decompression "JAR.EXE e -y -o%f %a". Suggestions
  for other/better switches are welcome.


FSetup
======
- Now there is a native OS/2 version of FSetup!
- FSetup now always performs an AutoUpdate procedure when exiting.
- IMPORTANT: when leaving the Area Manager, FMail now no longer asks you
  if you want to save the changes you made. FMail now saves the changes
  immediatly after you exit a specific area.
- New alias F9 for the F5 function key in the Area Manager and Node Manager.
  New alias F10 to exit Area Manager and Node Manager.
- New option in the Node Manager: you now can use the F8 key to get a list
  of all areas a node is connected to. Later it will be possible to add new
  areas this way.
