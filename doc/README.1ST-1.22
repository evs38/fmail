BUG FIX UPDATE 1.22
===================
This is a bug fix update of FMail 1.20. I didn't have time to test everything
extensively, so please be careful and make a backup first! I'll be away for
a couple of weeks, so I can't answer all messages immediatly.

IF YOU CARRY MORE ECHO AREAS THAN THE STANDARD VERSION OF FSETUP CAN HANDLE
===========================================================================
The current version of FSetup requires more memory than the previous ones.
As a consequence, you may encounter problems when entering the Area Manager.
I'll try to find a solution as soon as possible. For the time being, you
could try using the DPMI version of FSetup which can be found in the FMail
DPMI package. You can only use this version of FSetup if you use a 80386
computer or higher.

NEW LOG OPTION IN FMAIL
=======================
FMail is now able to log all failed file open commands. You can enable this by
setting the switch "File open errors" or the switch "DEBUG: log all" to Yes.
A file open error message does _NOT_ necessarily mean that there is something
wrong. Not every file that FMail tries to open has to exist. The option is
meant for debugging purposes, so normally you should DISABLE this option!!!

MIXING DPMI 16/32 VERSIONS
==========================
The FMail DPMI package contains both 16 bit and 32 bit versions. Running
those versions at the same time may cause problems. So don't try to start
FSetup (16 bit) and FMailX32 or FToolsX32 at the same time. I'll try to
find a solution for this problem.

WHICH FMAIL TO USE
==================
Standard DOS version:   If you run a 8086 or 80286 computer or if you have
                        a 80386 computer or higher and you don't carry too
                        many echomail areas.
DPMI version:           If you use a 80386 computer or higher and carry
                        more areas than the standard version can handle.
Windows/32 version      If you run FMail under Windows/95 or NT.
OS/2 version:           if you run FMail under OS/2.
