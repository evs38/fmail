I have released a new version of FMail (1.66).

For now, only the Win32 version has been created. You can download it from sourceforge here:

If you need any one of the other versions (DOS, 386, ...) please let me know and I see what I can do...

The main latest changes are:

- Sort SEEN-BY list before usage. This fixes a bug where exporting didn't function properly when SEEN-BY's were used.
- -aka Option can now be used while posting to an echomail area.
- Completely removed key checking code. FMail (with or without a key file) should behave as a registered version.

But there are more little changes and some bug fixes. You can read the complete list here:
