I have released a new version of FMail (1.68).

Only the Win32 version has been created. You can download it from sourceforge
here:

The most important change since the last release is: FMail can now put plain
uncompressed .pkt files in it's outbound destinations, if you select 'None' as
compressor for nodes.

But there are a lot more changes and fixes. For the full list see the Changelog
file inside the zip release file.
